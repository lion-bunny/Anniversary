                <h2>Our Journey Together</h2>
                <p>Adhya, you‚Äôve been nothing but a blessing ever since the day you came into my life. You completely changed what I thought a relationship would be like, and I grew more and more dependent on you every day. You‚Äôre the reason I sleep at night smiling, and wake up excited to see a good morning text. You‚Äôre the one whose texts bring a big smile to my face, no matter what time of day it is. I love every single thing about you ‚Äì your gorgeous brown eyes, your beautiful eyelashes, your cute little nose, your pretty lips (that my lips love too HEHE), your so good smelling hair. But what‚Äôs more is how sweet of a personality you have ‚Äì you‚Äôre so kind, so caring, and see the best in me and everyone. You‚Äôre supportive and always there for me, whether I need someone to rant to or someone to hug. I feel like I can always rely on you. And your hugs make me forget about everything and in those moments all I can think about is how much I love you. 

                    <br> So for all that, thank you Adhya. Thank you for being mine, for giving me all those amazing moments the past year. Thank you for being my girlfriend, but most importantly, a partner I know I can always count on. Thank you for getting me through the hard times and celebrating through the good ones, for giving me things to look forward to. Thank you for everything my bhangaram I‚Äôll always be so grateful for you.

                <h2>Memorable Moments</h2>
                <p>We‚Äôve made so many memories together Adhya, and here are some of my favorite ones‚Ä¶

                    <br>
                    
                    One year ago, the day I asked you to be my girlfriend, I remember so clearly. We spent time together in Live Oak, you gave me a Lego set and a lion and twix!! and a card that I read so often even now. I asked you out to prom, and I was so happy when you said yes. And after we cuddled on the play structure, I remember how much my heart was thumping under the lamp before I asked you. I had practiced a hundred times before about how I would ask you, but in that moment I forgot everything. Thank you for saying yes Adhya, and thank you for being my girlfriend. You make every moment ever so special. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Our first non-Live Oak date was at Old Ranch, and I remember our first kiss so clearly. We had talked so much about it, but I felt so shy and I had so many butterflies in my stomach. But no matter how awkward that first peck was, it was perfect Adhya. Sitting on the bench seeing the most beautiful sunset ever with the most beautiful girl ever made it perfect. (I also remember how bad you lost in basketball :P) 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Our summer dates and those in the Lot were so amazing Adhya. But one moment I can‚Äôt forget is our first kiss kiss! I remember how nervous we both were, and how we were both trying to play it off, and when we first finally tried, it was ‚Ä¶ SO NICE hehehe. I think that our tongues have honestly spent a long time together these past few months üòÄ. Even though the firsts are always awkward, I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm experiencing them with you my baby. I love you ‚ô•Ô∏è
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    I loved hoco sooo much and everyone could see you‚Äôre mine hehehe and I loved holding your hand while moshing and hugging you after it was done and talking to you and just everything becomes a million times better when it‚Äôs with you my love. 
                    
                    <br> 
                    
                    Soooo I also remember the first day I touched chocolates HEHEHE. Honestly you‚Äôre just so hot so this is your fault not mine but that was the most insane day ever oh my god. In the parking lot of the movies I thought I was in heaven honestly hehee. And through all the naughty things that have happened since !! I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs been with you Adhu, and I can‚Äôt imagine that with anyone else. I love you my baby, and thank you for understanding even though it took a few tries hehe and for being so sweet about it. I love you more than anything my Adhya. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Through all the memories we‚Äôve made and those we‚Äôll continue to make, I promise I‚Äôll love you the most in the world. I promise I‚Äôll always make sure you‚Äôre happy, care for you, lighten up your days, and always, always be there for you. The more I think about the past year the more I‚Äôm realizing how special every moment becomes when I spend it with you. And that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre so special Adhya, in every single way, and I‚Äôm so lucky to have you as my girlfriend. I can‚Äôt ever put into words how much I love you, and I know that love continues to grow every day. I love you my Adhu ‚ô•Ô∏è
